# Caesar-Cipher
Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. Each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B and so on. Method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his officials.
